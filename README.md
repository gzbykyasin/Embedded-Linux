# User Space (/dev/mem) Example for Embedded Linux
MPU Cortex A7 is imx6ull. 
Any SOM of this MPU will also work. 
Manufacturers may not have given access to some registration addresses when developing kernels. 
In this case, error messages appear and you realize that access is not given.
You will learn the registration addresses in detail by clicking the "https://www.nxp.com/webapp/sps/download/preDownload.jsp?render=true" link.
Good luck to everyone. 
Wash your hands abundantly during these times of virus and code them clean :)
